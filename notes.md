# GitHub & Git

Git provides:

1. "version tracking in a repository"
2. "the ability to clone a copy of the repository to a different location"

The **"push"** command sends local changes up to the GitHub repository so both are in sync.  The **"pull"** command allows for others to pull down commits into their local repositories.  The **"fetch"** command give you the most recent information on GitHub without modifying your local repository.  The **"status"** command shows differences between clones and any missing commits.  

## forking
- "A fork is similar to cloning a repository to your development environment, but it clones to GitHub instead."
* "GitHub allows you to create a fork of any repository on GitHub. You just push the Fork button from the repository's GitHub page. You can then make modifications to the repository fork and push the changes as a pull request."


# The Console
## Command Line Crash Course Info

CLI tools: command line interface tools

CMD: the command prompt

WSL: Windows Subsystem for Linux

Terminal: "a software that starts and connects to a shell"

Shell: "your session and session environment"

The Command Line: "the literal line where you enter commands and the cursor blinks"

### Some Useful commands
- cd: move around directory
- ls: list a directory's contents
- pwd: show present working directory
- mkdir: make a directory
- touch: create files and modify metadata
- cp: copy files or directories
- mv: move files or directories
- rm: delete files or directories
- curl: download files found at a URL
- grep: search for text
- less, cat: view a file's contents
- awk, tr, sed: transform text

Command options are "modifiers" placed at the end of a command.

### Special Characters
- "|": pass in the command on the left to the command on the right
- ">": redirect output to a file (overwrites)
- ">>" redirect output to a file (creates new, if exists)
### Keyboard Shortcuts
CTRL-R: "use type ahead to find previous commands"

CTRL-C: terminate the current command

# Amazon Web Services - EC2

- "A security group represents the rules for allowing access to your servers. Security group rules specify both the port that is accessible on your server, and the source IP address that requests are allowed from."
- "You can stop your server at any time. Don't confuse this with terminating your server which completely destroys it. Stopping your server just powers down the device."
  > Note that your elastic IP address is allocated until your release it, not until you terminate your instance. So make sure you release it when you no longer need it. Otherwise you will get a nasty $3 bill every month.
  
  how to remote shell into the server:

  >  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]

# Amazon Web Services - Route 53

  **DNS**: Domain Name System
  **Route 53**: the AWS service that handles DNS
  **TLD**: Top-level Domain
  **SOA**: Start of authority

  # Caddy

  - "Caddy is a web service that listens for incoming HTTP requests. Caddy then either serves up the requested static files or routes the request to another web service"
  - "ability to route requests is called a gateway, or reverse proxy, and allows you to expose multiple web services (i.e. your project services) as a single external web service (i.e. Caddy)."
  - Caddy handles the creation and rotation of web certificates (HTTPS)
  - Caddy serves all static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
  - Caddy acts as a "gateway" for subdomain requests

### Configuration file

  > ~/Caddyfile

### HTML files

> ~/public_html

# HTTPS, TLS, and web certificates

**HTTP** refers to *non-secure hpytext transport protocol*.

*Hypertext Transport Protocol* (HTTPS) is a secure version of HTTP.  Data is encrypted using *Transport Layer Security* (TLS).  *SSL* refers to *Secure Sockets Layer*.

## Web Certificates

- They are generated by a 3rd party using "public/private key encryption"
- Caddy uses *Let's Encrypt"" for web certificates

# CodePen

CodePen is a coding sandbox website allowing for experimental capabilities with HTML, CSS< JavaScript, and React.

**"When working with assignments that use CodePen to submit your work, you will do the following steps:"**
>1. Either create a new pen, or fork an existing example pen.
>2. Conduct the experiment as defined by the assignment.
>3. Save your assignment periodically so that you don't lose any work. In order to keep your CodePen account organized you should consider using pen collections for different technologies.
>4. Submit the pen's URL in Canvas along with a description of some interesting thing that you learned.

# Hypertext Markup Language

HTML is used for website content structre.  It was originally made to be a "publishing format for web documents, or pages."  From there, websites have changed from *singel page applications* (SPAs) to groups of pages that form a multi-page application* (MPA).

**HTML is built using elements and tags**

Some common HTML elements:

- html: the top level page structure
- head: metadata regarding the page and the title
- body: the general content structure
- main: main content structure (not including headers, footers, etc.)

Comments are made in HTML by using "<!--" and "-->".

**"The Visual appearance of the web page won't really change until we start stying the page with CSS"** 

### Attributes

All HTML elements may have attributes.

Example:
> "<p **id="hello"** **class="greeting"**>Hello world</p>"

### Hyperlinks

A hyperlink provides the ability to take you from on page to another.  In HTML, a hyperlink is designated by "an anchor (a) that has an attribute containg the address of the hyperlink reference (href)."

Example:
> "<**a href="https://byu.edu"**>Go to the Y</a>"

### HTML History
- 1990: HTML, format tags
- 1995: HTML2, tables and internationalization
- 1997: HTML3, MathML, CSS, and frame tags
- 1999: HTML4, external CSS
- 2014: HTML5, email, password, media, and semantic tags

# HTML Structure

Common elements for structure in HTML are body, header, footer, main, section, aside, p, table, ol/ul, div, and span.  There are two main types of structural elements in HTML: block and inline.  Block elements are "distinctive blocks" that break the flow of content structure.  Inline elements do not disrupt the flow of a block element's content.

# HTML Input

Some HTML input elements include the following: form, fieldset, input, select, optgroup, option, textarea, label, output, meter.

### Form Element

- The purpose of the form element is "to submit the values of the inputs that it contains."
- You are "not required to have a form element to use input elements."

### Input Element

The input element can include a variety of input types.  Some input element types are: text, password, email, tel, url, number, checkbox, radio, range, date, datetime-local, month, week, color, file, submit.

Input elements share common attributes:

 - **name**: "The name of the input. This is submitted as the name of the input if used in a form"
 - **disabled**: "Disables the ability for the user to interact with the input"
 - **value**: "The initial value of the input"
 - **required**: "Signifies that a value is required in order to be valid"
