# GitHub & Git

Git provides:

1. "version tracking in a repository"
2. "the ability to clone a copy of the repository to a different location"

The **"push"** command sends local changes up to the GitHub repository so both are in sync.  The **"pull"** command allows for others to pull down commits into their local repositories.  The **"fetch"** command give you the most recent information on GitHub without modifying your local repository.  The **"status"** command shows differences between clones and any missing commits.  

## forking
- "A fork is similar to cloning a repository to your development environment, but it clones to GitHub instead."
* "GitHub allows you to create a fork of any repository on GitHub. You just push the Fork button from the repository's GitHub page. You can then make modifications to the repository fork and push the changes as a pull request."
